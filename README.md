# Burger-App

## Eat-Da-Burger! It is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. User can also input the burgers once they have eatan it. 

### Overview 

### I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). I used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
